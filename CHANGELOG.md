## 1.0.0 - 2015-01-26

This new version is the first one of the v1.0 branch!

For this version the major part of the code has be rewritten to be cleaner and easier to debug.
It also brings some new features and fixes a lot of bugs.

There are some major changes that should solve a lot of issues :

* The plugin doesn't override ```Repository::Git``` object anymore. Instead it introduces a new type of repository in Redmine : ```Gitolite``` repositories.
That means that you can have standard Redmine Git repositories as before and Gitolite repositories in the **same time**.
*Note that only Gitolite repositories have advanced features (mirrors, post urls, etc...).*

* The second major change concerns the Storage strategy already discussed [here](https://github.com/jbox-web/redmine_git_hosting/issues/199).
```unique_repo_identifier``` and ```hierarchical_organisation``` are now combined in a single param : ```hierarchical_organisation```.

* And finally the third major change is the switch to [gitolite-rugged](https://github.com/oliverguenther/gitolite-rugged) thanks to Oliver Günther.

**Changes :**

* Big refactoring of GitoliteWrapper (thanks Oliver Günther)
* Switch to Gitlab Grack to provide Git SmartHTTP feature
* Add SSH key fingerprint field in database

**New features :**

* Export developer public ssh keys in Redmine REST API
* Export repository extras (mirrors, post receive urls, etc...) in Redmine REST API
* Add "go get" support for GoLang
* GitolitePlugins Sweepers and Extenders : to execute some actions after repository create/update/delete
* new GitCache adapters : Memcached and Redis (faster than the current database adapter)
* GitoliteHooks DSL to install your own Gitolite hooks globally
* Support for GitAnnex repositories
* [Support for branch permission / protected branches](https://github.com/jbox-web/redmine_git_hosting/issues/86)
* Add rake tasks for a fully automated install [#303](https://github.com/jbox-web/redmine_git_hosting/issues/303)

**Fixes :**

* Hooks URL should be configurable
* Fix [#223](https://github.com/jbox-web/redmine_git_hosting/pull/223) (fix https:// notifications if TLSvX is mandatory)
* Fix [#240](https://github.com/jbox-web/redmine_git_hosting/issues/240) (Allow modification of the gitolite-admin repository from a different location)
* Fix [#286](https://github.com/jbox-web/redmine_git_hosting/issues/286) (Link to "my public keys" is shown even if right is not granted)
* Fix [#310](https://github.com/jbox-web/redmine_git_hosting/issues/310) (compatibility with redmine_scm_creator plugin)
* Fix [#311](https://github.com/jbox-web/redmine_git_hosting/issues/311) (mirror repository URLs should permit dots in repository path)
* Purge RecycleBin on fetch_changesets ([Configuration notes]({{ site.baseurl }}/configuration/notes/#empty-recycle-bin-periodically))

**Other :**

* Bump to last version of Git Multimail hook
* Bump ZeroClipboard to version v2.1.1
* Bump Highcharts to version 4.0.3

**Notes :**

Thanks to the work of Oliver Günther (really thank you), the plugin is now a lot more simple in many ways :

* the plugin is scriptless : no more need of ```gitolite_scripts_dir``` and shell scripts to wrap calls to sudo. Now, the only required dir is the ```gitolite_temp_dir``` to clone the Gitolite admin repository.
* SSH keys are stored in Gitolite in a directory tree under ```ssh_keys```. No more need of timestamped key name :)

Example :

```sh
gitolite-admin.git/
├── conf
│   └── gitolite.conf
└── keydir
    ├── redmine_git_hosting
    │   ├── redmine_admin_1
    │   │   └── redmine_my_key
    │   │       └── redmine_admin_1.pub
    │   └── redmine_admin_1_deploy_key_1
    │       └── redmine_deploy_key_1
    │           └── redmine_admin_1_deploy_key_1.pub
    └── redmine_gitolite_admin_id_rsa.pub
```

## 0.7.10 - 2015-01-26

* Fix [#324](https://github.com/jbox-web/redmine_git_hosting/issues/324) (Unable to flag repository as Main)
* Fix [#326](https://github.com/jbox-web/redmine_git_hosting/issues/326) (Error occurred while loading the routes definition)
* Fix [#329](https://github.com/jbox-web/redmine_git_hosting/issues/329) ("internal Error" when trying to edit a newly created repo)

**Notes :**

  **Important !**

  This is the last version of the v0.7 branch. **There won't be new releases under this branch**.

  That means that everyone should migrate to the new 1.0 version :)

  **Important !**

  Before migrating to the new 1.0 you **MUST** migrate to this version (0.7.10).

  It includes a Rake task that prepare the migration to 1.0, so **don't miss that step!**

## 0.7.9 - 2014-12-29

* Fix [#218](https://github.com/jbox-web/redmine_git_hosting/issues/218) (I18n warnings)
* Fix [#288](https://github.com/jbox-web/redmine_git_hosting/issues/288) (wrong deployment key identifier attribution that may lead to a security issue)
* Fix [#317](https://github.com/jbox-web/redmine_git_hosting/issues/317) (inconsistent url's of hierarchical repositories in sub-projects)
* gitolite-admin is a forbiden repository identifier

## 0.7.8 - 2014-11-08

* Fix collision in method name with Redmine Jenkins Plugin
* Backport patch from [pull #266](https://github.com/jbox-web/redmine_git_hosting/pull/266)
* Fix [#246](https://github.com/jbox-web/redmine_git_hosting/issues/246) (init.rb - config values not taken)
* Fix [#258](https://github.com/jbox-web/redmine_git_hosting/issues/258) (wrong hook installation place on gitolite 3.x)
* Fix [#289](https://github.com/jbox-web/redmine_git_hosting/issues/289) (url to wiki goes nowhere)

**Notes :**

  **Important !**

As explained in [Gitolite documentation](https://gitolite.com/gitolite/non-core.html#localcode) hooks should be installed in a separate directory.
This new version fixes Gitolite hooks install path for Gitolite v3.

Hooks are now stored by default in ```<gitolite user home dir>/local```. You can override this in the plugin settings.

Note that the directory must be **a relative path** to the Gitolite user home directory.

You'll also have to update your ```.gitolite.rc``` accordingly :

    LOCAL_CODE  =>  "$ENV{HOME}/local"

## 0.7.7 - 2014-09-10

* Merge [#259](https://github.com/jbox-web/redmine_git_hosting/pull/259) (Some (very old) repositories have been indentified as empty)

* Bump to jbox-gitolite 1.2.6 which depends on [gitlab-grit 2.7.1](https://github.com/gitlabhq/grit/blob/master/History.txt)

**Notes :**

Until this version, the plugin silently failed when pushing data to Gitolite Admin. Now when an error happens on push, you should get this in the log :

## 0.6.3 - 2014-02-23

This is a bugfix release.

This is the last release of the 0.6.x branch.

The 'v0.6' is kept as archive and will be no longer supported.

## 0.6.2 - 2013-07-29

This is a security and bugfix release.

This releases fixes a high risk vulnerability, allowing an attacker to gain shell access to the server (CVE-2013-4663).

We strongly advise you to update your plugin!

## 0.6.1 - 2013-04-05

This is a bugfix release.

## 0.6.0 - 2013-03-25

This is a compatibility release.

The plugin is now compatible with Redmine 2.x (and Redmine 1.x).

## 0.5.2 - 2012-12-25

This is a bug-fix release.

* Fixed a migration problem with PostGreSQL (for uninstalling).
* Fix to allow validations to fail properly on Project creation for Redmine < 1.4
* Fix to prevent repository creation from stealing preexisting repositories in gitolite (which could happen under specialized circumstances).
* Fix to handle old versions of sudo (< 1.7.3) during repair of the administrative key
* Fix to preserve other administrative keys in the gitolite configuration file.  Previously, the plugin would delete all but the first one.  This fix is useful for people who want to have separate administrative keys for access to the gitolite config file.
* Fixed weird behavior on Repository page when using multiple repos/project.  Showed up when on non-default repo when trying to switch to branch other than master.  Would switch back to default repository.

## 0.5.1 - 2012-10-31

This is a bug-fix release.

* Post-Receive URLs should now work with SSL (i.e. URLs of the form "https://xxx")
* Additional patches for backward compatibility with ChiliProject/Redmine < 1.4. In this category was a problem with editing Git repo parameters as well as a minor bug that caused problems with adding members to projects that didn't have a Git repo.
* Additional patches to support Ruby 1.9.x.  Includes fix to post-receive hook and change in meaning of Module#instance_methods.
* Patched installation so that can install Redmine from *scratch* (i.e. run `rake db:migrate` on empty DB) with plugin already in place.
* Latest migration should now work with PostGreSQL.  This was broken in 0.5.0x.

## 0.5.0 - 2012-10-03

This is a feature release.

* New : Compatibility with Redmine 1.4
* Fix : Uninstall of plugin should work properly now.
* Fix : Problems with patching on some installations should be fixed now (introduced in a recent revision).

## 0.4.6 - 2012-08-22

This is a feature release.

* New: Added Deployment Credentials, which are public keys associated directly with a repository rather
than through a user.  These credentials can be created directly from the repository settings page.  Since
they are named (like other public keys), they can be reused for other repositories, if desired.  Note
that only **managers** (or **administrators**) can create deployment credentials (or deployment keys).  Further, deployment keys and credentials are owned by the original creator and appear in their "my account" page.

* New : Key validation and uniqueness.  The format, properties, and uniqueness of keys are validated before allowing them to be saved.  Note that actual keys must be unique across a whole gitolite installation (otherwise the access control mechanism doesn't work).  At the moment, this validation allows keys of type "ssh-rsa" and "ssh-dss".
* New : Ability to utilize alternate gitolite configuration file.
* New : handle archiving of projects.  Archived projects stay in the gitolite repository but are deactivated in the gitolite config file.  All Redmine keys are removed and replaced with a token key called "redmine_archived_project".
* New : Post-receive URLs configured from a repository settings page.  When commits occur, configured URLs will be POSTed with json information about the commit, roughly in the same format as github commits.  The POSTed payload is described here: http://help.github.com/post-receive-hooks/.
* New : Repository mirrors have more configuration options.  Rather than forcing the remote repository to be a complete mirror of the local repository (i.e. --mirror), repository mirrors can now specific an explicit reference specification for which branches to update and/or select whether to force update or require nothing more than a fast-forward.
* Fix : Change in login name on User settings screen properly changes keys in keydir.
* Fix : Fixed cases in which delete of user from project ACL and delete of user didn't clean up gitolite.conf
* Fix : Fixed problem with failed validation in user settings screen.
* Fix : Remove extra control characters (such as line breaks) as well as leading and trailing whitespace in public keys
* Fix : Validations for public keys now reflected back to the user interface.
* Fix : Deselection of repository module now has same effect as archiving project. The repository is marked in gitolite.conf as "redmine_disabled_project".  When project repository module is re-enabled, the repository is reconnected automatically.

Prior to this, repository module deselection was treated inconsistently.

## 0.4.5 - 2012-04-23

* Fixed missed case for compatibility with Redmine 1.1-Stable.  This patch allows the mirror functionality to work.
* Fixed bad interaction between cron cleanup of /tmp and access to gitolite-admin repository in /tmp.  Behavior could cause user keys to appear to be deleted, even though they remain in the redmine database.  This behavior has likely been a part of this plugin since before this branch was forked (pre 0.4.2).

## 0.4.4 - 2012-04-01

This release includes feature enhancements and bug fixes.

Compatibility with Redmine 1.1-Stable. A couple of patches were included to permit this plugin to work with older Redmine releases.

* New settings to configure the /tmp and /bin directories (**gitTemporaryDir** and **gitScriptDir** respectively).
* New settings for the default "Daemon Mode" (**gitDaemonDefault**), "SmartHTTP mode" (**gitHttpDefault**), and "Notify CIA mode" (**gitNotifyCIADefault**) for new repositories.
* Better script support for installing scripts in the /bin directory.
* Updated installation instructions in the README.
* Better recovery from loss of administrative key in gitolite -- assuming use of gitolite version >= 2.0.3.
* Fix : Improvements to repository mirror support.
* Fix : Support '@' in user names for http access (externally converted to '%40').
* Fix : Syntax fixes to allow use of Ruby 1.9.
* Fix : Support for git-daemon now working correctly.  The "daemon" key was not being removed correctly and projectgs with "daemon" support were not being deleted.
* Fix : Better handling of null-buffer condition in smart-http.
* Fix : Fixed language tags in localization files.

## 0.4.3 - 2012-02-01

This release includes feature enhancements and bug fixes.

This release includes a complete rewrite of the update_repository() functionality with an eye toward better resilience.

This code will automatically recover from a variety of weird failure modes which originally could occur.
Further, execution of fetch_changesets will resynchronize the gitolite.conf file, fixing any inconsistencies that might have crept into this file.
Co-existence of Redmine-managed and non-redmine-managed repositories in the gitolite.conf file is supported. Some specific things that will be resynched :

* Missing keys will be added and unused keys will be removed from the keydir directory.
* Entries in gitolite.conf will be updated with new path information as necessary.
* If proper setting is selected, orphan repo entries will be removed from gitolite.conf file, and the repositories themselves will be moved to the new recycle bin in the gitolite homedirectory.
* Hooks will be checked and repaired as necessary.

This code is now explicitly compatible with Redmine 1.3-stable.

* Added user-edit screen to allow administrator to examine and edit users keys.
* Git Server parameter now supports a port specification.
* Other bug fuxes: mirrors now report status properly.

## 0.4.2 - 2011-12-01

This release includes feature enhancements and bug fixes.

* One of the most important aspects of this release is a fix for the performance problems that plagued earlier versions of the plugin for post 1.2 Redmine. Fetch_changesets operations should now be possible.
* A second aspect is support for selinux.  Scripts have been placed into a separate /bin directory which is placed at the root of the plugin (i.e. REDMINE_ROOT/vendor/plugins/redmine_git_hosting/bin).  A set of rake tasks have been added to assist in installing selinux tags and pre-building scripts in the bin directory.
