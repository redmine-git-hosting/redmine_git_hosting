Shoulda Context makes it easy to write understandable and maintainable tests
under Minitest and Test::Unit within Rails projects or plain Ruby projects. It's
fully compatible with your existing tests and requires no retooling to use.

## Usage

Instead of writing Ruby methods with `lots_of_underscores`, Shoulda Context lets
you name your tests and group them together using English.

At a minimum, the gem provides some convenience layers around core Minitest /
Test::Unit functionality. For instance, this test case:

```ruby
class CalculatorTest < Minitest::Test
  context "a calculator" do
    setup do
      @calculator = Calculator.new
    end

    should "add two numbers for the sum" do
      assert_equal 4, @calculator.sum(2, 2)
    end

    should "multiply two numbers for the product" do
      assert_equal 10, @calculator.product(2, 5)
    end
  end
end
```

turns into:

```ruby
class CalculatorTest < Minitest::Test
  def setup
    @calculator = Calculator.new
  end

  define_method "test_: a calculator should add two numbers for the sum" do
    assert_equal 4, @calculator.sum(2, 2)
  end

  define_method "test_: a calculator should multiply two numbers for the product" do
    assert_equal 10, @calculator.product(2, 5)
  end
end
```

However, Shoulda Context also provides functionality apart from Minitest /
Test::Unit that allows you to shorten tests drastically by making use of
RSpec-compatible matchers. For instance, with [Shoulda
Matchers][shoulda-matchers] you can write such tests as:

```ruby
class User < ActiveSupport::TestCase
  context "validations" do
    subject { FactoryBot.build(:user) }

    should validate_presence_of(:first_name)
    should validate_presence_of(:last_name)
    should validate_uniqueness_of(:email)
    should_not allow_value('weird').for(:email)
  end
end
```

## API

### DSL

The primary method in Shoulda Context's API is `context`, which declares a group
of a tests.

These methods are available inside of a `context`:

* `setup` â€” a DSL-y alternative to defining a `setup` method
* `teardown` â€” a DSL-y alternative to defining a `teardown` method
* `should` â€” There are two forms:
  1. when passed a name + block, creates a test equivalent to defining a
  `test_` method
  2. when passed a matcher, creates a test that will run the matcher, asserting
  that it passes
* `should_not` â€” like the matcher version of `should`, but creates a test that
  asserts that the matcher fails
* `should_eventually` â€” allows you to temporarily skip tests
* `context` â€” creates a subcontext

These methods are available within a test case class, but outside of a
`context`:

* `should` â€” same as above
* `should_not` â€” same as above
* `should_eventually` â€” same as above
* `described_type` â€” returns the class being tested, as determined by the class
  name of the outermost class
* `subject` â€” lets you define an object that is the primary focus of the tests
  within a context; this is most useful when using a matcher as the matcher will
  make use of this as _its_ subject

And these methods are available inside of a test (whether defined via a method
or via `should`):

* `subject` â€” an instance of the class under test, which is derived
  automatically from the name of the test case class but is overridable via the
  class method version of `subject` above

### Assertions

In addition to the main API, the gem also provides some extra assertions that
may be of use:

* `assert_same_elements` â€” compares two arrays for equality, but ignoring
  ordering
* `assert_contains` â€” asserts that an array has an item
* `assert_does_not_contain` â€” the opposite of `assert_contains`
* `assert_accepts` â€” what `should` uses internally; asserts that a matcher
  object matches against a value
* `assert_reject` â€” what `should_not` uses internally; asserts that a matcher
  object does not match against a value

## Note on running tests

Normally, you will run a single test like this:

    ruby -I lib -I test path_to_test.rb -n name_of_test_method

When using Shoulda Context, however, you'll need to put a space after the test
name:

    ruby -I lib -I test path_to_test.rb -n "test_: a calculator should add two numbers for the sum. "

If this is too cumbersome, consider using the [m] gem to run tests instead:

    m path_to_test.rb:39

## Compatibility

Shoulda Context is tested and supported against Rails 4.x+, Minitest 4.x,
Test::Unit 3.x, and Ruby 2.4+.
