      # start is the starting vertex for the search

      # func is a Proc that when passed a vertex returns the heuristic 
      #   weight of sending the path through that node. It must always
      #   be equal to or less than the true cost
      # 
      # options are mostly callbacks passed in as a hash, the default block is 
      # :discover_vertex and weight is assumed to be the label for the Arc.
      # The following options are valid, anything else is ignored.
      #
      # * :weight => can be a Proc, or anything else is accessed using the [] for the
      #     the label or it defaults to using
      #     the value stored in the label for the Arc. If it is a Proc it will 
      #     pass the edge to the proc and use the resulting value.
      # * :discover_vertex => Proc invoked when a vertex is first discovered
      #   and is added to the open list.
      # * :examine_vertex  => Proc invoked when a vertex is popped from the
      #   queue (i.e., it has the lowest cost on the open list).
      # * :examine_edge    => Proc invoked on each out-edge of a vertex
      #   immediately after it is examined.
      # * :edge_relaxed    => Proc invoked on edge (u,v) if d[u] + w(u,v) < d[v].
      # * :edge_not_relaxed=> Proc invoked if the edge is not relaxed (see above).
      # * :black_target    => Proc invoked when a vertex that is on the closed 
      #     list is "rediscovered" via a more efficient path, and is re-added
      #     to the OPEN list.
      # * :finish_vertex    => Proc invoked on a vertex when it is added to the 
      #     closed list, which happens after all of its out edges have been
      #     examined. 
      #
      # Returns array of nodes in path, or calls block on all nodes, 
      # upon failure returns nil

      # astar_edge_relaxed {|e| ... } for any of the callbacks
      #
      # The criteria for expanding a vertex on the open list is that it has the
      # lowest f(v) = g(v) + h(v) value of all vertices on open.
      #
      # The time complexity of A* depends on the heuristic. It is exponential 
      # in the worst case, but is polynomial when the heuristic function h
      # meets the following condition: |h(x) - h*(x)| < O(log h*(x)) where h*  
      # is the optimal heuristic, i.e. the exact cost to get from x to the goal.
